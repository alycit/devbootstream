There are hundreds of people involved with Dev Bootcamp, from students and staff to mentors and hiring companies.  Each of them has a vested interest in the success of the program.  A lot of these people post blogs, pictures and tweets.  A lot of us want and easy way to keep up with all those posts, pictures and tweets.  That's were BootStream comes in.

BootStream is a live feed of all things boot. 

BootStream is a final project built by four members of the Golden Bears 2013 cohort at Dev Bootcamp (devbootcamp.com).
